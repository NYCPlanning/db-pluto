Please note that we're still working on this repo as we optimize the build processes, update the sources for the raw data inputs, and implement better technologies.  We're excited that PLUTO users can now look under the hood and begin exploring how PLUTO is built and each of its individual fields are calculated. If you have suggestions or find any problems, please open an issue, or if you have questions please reach out to us directly.

## __About PLUTO__

The Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) **reports tax lot and building characteristics, and geographic/political/administrative districts at the tax lot level** from data maintained by the Department of City Planning (DCP), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), and Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).

DCP merges PLUTO data with the DCP modified version of DOF’s Digital Tax Map (`dof_dtm`) to create MapPLUTO for use with various geographic information systems.

The PLUTO data contain one record per tax lot except for condominiums.  PLUTO data contain one record per condominium complex instead of records for each condominium unit tax lot.  A tax lot is usually a parcel of real property.  The parcel can be under water, vacant, or contain one or more buildings or structures.  The Department of Finance assigns a tax lot number to each condominium unit and a "billing" tax lot number to the Condominium Complex. A Condominium Complex is defined as one or more structures or properties under the auspices of the same condominium association.  DCP summarizes DOF's condominium unit tax lot data so that each Condominium Complex within a tax block is represented by only one record.  The Condominium Complex record is assigned the "billing" tax lot number when one exists.  When the "billing" tax lot number has not yet been assigned by DOF, the lowest tax lot number within the tax block of the Condominium Complex is assigned.

## Release versioning

PLUTO now uses version numbering YYvMAJOR.MINOR
1. YY for the last two digits of the release year
2. MAJOR version for using the latest versions of all input data
2. MINOR version for using the latest versions of particular input data

Datasets updated in minor realeases are intended to keep the property records in the [ZoLa portal](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/) accurate and currently include:
- DCP Zoning data
- DCP E-Designation data

> For all releases, input data versions are documented in their `source_data_versions.csv` file.

### Limitations
DCP provides PLUTO for informational purposes only. DCP does not warranty and is not liable for the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of PLUTO.

## __How you can help__

We want to make PLUTO most useful and accurate for its users, so open an [issue](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/db-pluto/issues) to report an error or suggest how we can improve PLUTO.

## Data Build Instructions

### Major Version (XXvX)
TODO review and revise major versions instructions
#### I. Build PLUTO Through CI
1. Ensure input datasets are archived in DigitalOcean. There's an issue template in this repo to help track this.
2. On a new branch, ensure the new and previous PLUTO versions in `version.env` are correct
3. Run the build action using the new branch

#### II. Build PLUTO on Your Own Machine
1. make sure you have [__psql__](https://packages.debian.org/sid/postgresql-client-common) installed
2. `./01_dataloading.sh` : load all input data into build environment
3.  `./02_build.sh` : Build PLUTO and MapPLUTO.
4.  `./03_corrections.sh` : Apply pluto research corrections
5.  `./04_archive.sh` : Archive output to EDM_DATA
6.  `./05_export.sh` : Export PLUTO csv, MapPLUTO shapefile and pluto_corrections file

### Minor Version (XXvX.X)
#### I. Build PLUTO Through CI
1. Ensure input datasets are archived in DigitalOcean. There's an issue template in this repo to help track this.
2. On a new branch, esnure the new and previous PLUTO versions in the `version.env` file are correct
3. Ensure the input dataset versions in `version.env` are identical to those used the last major realease
3. Run the build action using the new branch and the "minor version" input set to true

#### II. Build PLUTO on Your Own Machine
1. make sure you have [__psql__](https://packages.debian.org/sid/postgresql-client-common) installed
2. `./01_dataloading_minor.sh` : load all input data into build environment
3.  `./02_build.sh` : Build PLUTO and MapPLUTO.
4.  `./03_corrections.sh` : Apply pluto research corrections
5.  `./04_archive.sh` : Archive output to EDM_DATA
6.  `./05_export.sh` : Export PLUTO csv, MapPLUTO shapefile and pluto_corrections file
