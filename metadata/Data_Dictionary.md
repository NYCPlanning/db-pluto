|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Borough|Borough|Department of City Planning based on data from: Department of Finance - RPAD Master File.|- []|- []|Plain Text|BX, BK, MN, QN, SI|N/A|- []|Two portions of the city, Marble Hill and Rikers Island, are each legally located in one borough but are serviced by different boroughs. The BOROUGH codes associated with these areas are the boroughs they are legally located in. Specifically, Marble Hill is serviced by the Bronx but is legally located in Manhattan and has a Manhattan BOROUGH code. Rikers Island has a Bronx BOROUGH code because it is legally located in the Bronx although it is serviced by Queens.|
|2|Block|Block|The tax block in which the tax lot is located. Each tax block is unique within a borough (see BOROUGH).|- []|- []|Number|N/A|N/A|- []|N/A|
|3|Lot|Lot|The number of the tax lot. Each tax lot is unique within a tax block (see BLOCK).|- []|- []|Number|N/A|N/A|- []|Each unit in a building that is a condominium is defined by the Department of Finance as a separate tax lot. To make condominium information more compatible with parcel information, the Department of City Planning aggregated condominium unit tax lot information so that each condominium complex within a tax block is represented by only one tax lot record. A condominium complex is defined as one or more structures or properties under the auspicies of the same condominium association. The Department of City Planning then assigned the condominium billing tax lot number to the condominium complex tax lot record. If the Department of Finance has not yet assigned a billing tax lot number to the condominium complex then the lowest tax lot number within the condominium complex was used. The Department of Finance DTM uses the formerly known as (FKA) Tax Lot number for Condominiums. The Department of City Planning has modified the Tax Lot number of DOF DTM by replacing the FKA with the condominiums billing tax lot number. Often the tax lot number can tell you the type of tax lot. Of course there are exceptions to each convention. Usually tax lot number '1-999' correspond with traditional tax lots; '1001-6999' correspond with condominium unit lots; '7501-7599' correspond with condominium billing lots; '8000-8899' correspond with subterranean tax lots; '8900-8999' correspond with DTM dummy tax lots; '9000-9899' correspond with air right tax lots. The Air Rights Tax Lot goes with the base Tax Lot or Donating Tax Lot. For example: If Tax Lot 32 has Air Rights, those Air Rights would be identified as 9032. When the structure is built the Air Rights Tax Lot is retired. Property owners do not have to create an Air Rights Tax Lot to transfer development rights.|
|4|CD|Community District|The community district (CD) or joint interest area (JIA) the tax lot is located in, or partially located.|- []|- []|Number|101-112: Manhattan Community Districts <br> 164: Central Park (JIA) <br> 201-212: Bronx Community District <br> 226: Van Cortlandt Park (JIA) <br> 227: Bronx Park (JIA)<br> 228: Pelham Bay Park (JIA) <br> 301-318: Brooklyn Community Districts <br> 355: Prospect Park (JIA) <br> 356: Brooklyn Gateway National Recreation Area (JIA) <br> 401-414: Queens Community Districts <br> 480: LaGuardia Airport (JIA) <br> 481: Flushing Meadow / Corona Park (JIA) <br> 482: Forest Park (JIA) <br> 483: JFK International Airport (JIA) <br> 484: Queens Gateway National Recreation Area (JIA) <br> 501-503: Staten Island Community Districts <br> 595: Staten Island Gateway National Recreation Area (JIA)|N/A|- []|The Department of City Planning - CD Layer for the DTM is used as the source when it identifies a community district for a tax lot. If a tax lot is split among more than one community district then PLUTO uses one of the community district numbers. If the Department of City Planning - CD Layer for the DTM does not identify a community district, the district is obtained from the Department of City Planning Geosupport System. If the community district is not available from the Geosupport System the DOF-RPAD Master file is used. If a tax lot is split by a community district boundary, only one community district is retained. Two portions of the city, Marble Hill and Rikers Island, are legally located in one borough and are each serviced by different boroughs. The COMMUNITY DISTRICT codes associated with these areas are the community districts they are serviced by. Specifically, Marble Hill is legally located in Manhattan but is serviced by the Bronx and has Bronx COMMUNITY DISTRICT codes of 207 or 208. Rikers Island has a Queens COMMUNITY DISTRICT code of 401 since it is serviced by Queens even though it is legally located in the Bronx.|

The TOTAL FLOOR AREA is for all of the structures on the tax lot, including stairwells, halls, elevator shafts, attics and extensions such as attached garages. Measurements are based on exterior dimensions and does take into account setbacks. If the FLOOR AREA, TOTAL BUILDING SOURCE CODE field has a value of 5, the floor area was calculated from the DOF RPAD Master File using the building dimensions and number of stories for ONLY the largest structure on the tax lot.
