psudo code

Jean

- (DONE) QA/QC lot area of old and new RPAD (count and report)
- (DONE) for zero or missing condo #s if there is a missing condo number you have to correct it
- (DONE) missing building class and frequency distribution (done)

- limit fields to only necessary fields
- make bbl valid

- sum 3 $ fields to get accessed total (value sum = current transactional value + tentative change + final change)

- Geocoding
-- BL, 1E, 1A --> what attributes are we getting from each?
-- no mathces from geocoding rerun through 1E again w/ GBAT control cards
-- still no matches
	- take all matched records 
	- find more frequently occurring census tract for a tax block
	- info applied to tax lots that so not have matches
	- BLCTOR1.dob
	- create geocodes file
	- from geocoding it pick up number of structures, which gets inserted into number of building field to replace RPAD value

- (DONE) if vacant building and (AV land = AV total) then zero out building frontage, building debth, stories, and number of buildings
- (DONE) if no lot area and no lot depth was = to acre then lot frantage x 43560 + .5

- (DONE)if lot area = 0 and if lot not irregular and lot depth adn lot front have values then multiply lot front x lot depth to get lot area

- gfa code and foot code > file with logic from Jean

- pick up owner from IPIS (boro, taxlot, block, easement)

- based on if bbl in list then changes building class  > file with bbls from Jean

-- reformat ADATE

FOLLOW-UP (with Lynn)
RPAD addresses that don't geocode --> send to GRU
# of structures - how are we getting this value in PAD

Jie
Part 1
DTM
base bbl -> billing bbl -> taxlot polygon
^using condo lookup table from DOF

Report
missing
split --> manually assign
merged lots --> condo, non condo

Pre BBL assignment

- delete fiels, premerge code, bbl assignemnet code, duplicate code

- CLIP --> what do we clip to?
- QA/QC 
- Don't delete slivers
- validation

Part 2 (tax lot / Community district file)
-- assign the CDs that the tax lot falls within 

Part 3
PLUTO is ready
Joing PLUTO onto base dtm to generate MapPLUTO
Generate files for each boro
	- map only lots
	- pluto only
	- map pluto
Edit xml metadata file and apply xml to each file and convert to pdf

Base DTM creation notes
- In the condo table delete duplicate records (base bbl and billing bbl are the same)
	xx	yy
	xx	yy <-- delete
- If base bbl is the same with differnt billing bbl manaual steps
	in DTM you'll see multiple polygons with same base bbl 
	manually assign billing bbl on of the billing as base bbl based on previous version of MapPLUTO
	Get info from DOF to know which polygon gets which billing bbl
	DTM has more info
	change mappluto flag
	xx aa <-- manually assign
	xx bb 
- In case where billing bbl is none take option where billing bbl is not null
	xx	11 <-- take this one 
	xx 	None
-- Merge non condo tax lots polygons with the same base bbl
-- Assign billing bbl to condos lots and then merge based on bbl
-- Tax lots where BBL is NULL assign BBL based on previous MapPLUTO (fixed via DTM)
-- Recheck for duplicate bbl for polygons where one polygon is condo and the other is not condo
	-- always merge polygons - discretion as to if it becomes condo or non-condo lot

-- Use shoreline file that comes with DTM use to clip . erase with 0.05 tolerance

-- Validate clipped topology to check to make sure that everything in non clipped bbl w/in shoreline boundary is in clipped mappluto

-- store to SDE

-- create new bbl to be float
