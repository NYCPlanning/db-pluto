psudo code

Jean

- QA/QC lot area of old and new RPAD (count and report)
- for zero or missing condo #s if there is a missing condo number you have to correct it
- missing building class and frequency distribution (done)

- limit fields to only necessary fields
- make bbl valid

- sum 3 $ fields to get accessed total (value sum = current transactional value + tentative change + final change)

- Geocoding
-- BL, 1E, 1A --> what attributes are we getting from each?
-- no mathces from geocoding rerun through 1E again w/ GBAT control cards
-- still no matches
	- take all matched records 
	- find more frequently occurring census tract for a tax block
	- info applied to tax lots that so not have matches
	- BLCTOR1.dob
	- create geocodes file
	- from geocoding it pick up number of structures, which gets inserted into number of building field to replace RPAD value

- if vacant building and (AV land = AV total) then zero out building frontage, building debth, stories, and number of buildings
- if no lot area and no lot depth was = to acre then lot frantage x 43560 + .5

- if lot area = 0 and if lot not irregular and lot depth adn lot front have values then multiply lot front x lot depth to get lot area

- gfa code and foot code > file with logic from Jean

- pick up owner from IPIS (boro, taxlot, block, easement)

- based on if bbl in list then changes building class  > file with bbls from Jean

-- reformat ADATE

FOLLOW-UP (with Lynn)
RPAD addresses that don't geocode --> send to GRU
# of structures - how are we getting this value in PAD

Jie
Part 1
DTM
base bbl -> billing bbl -> taxlot polygon
^using condo lookup table from DOF

Report
missing
split --> manually assign
merged lots --> condo, non condo

Pre BBL assignment

- delete fiels, premerge code, bbl assignemnet code, duplicate code

- CLIP --> what do we clip to?
- QA/QC 
- Don't delete slivers
- validation

Part 2 (tax lot / Community district file)
-- assign the CDs that the tax lot falls within 

Part 3
PLUTO is ready
Joing PLUTO onto base dtm to generate MapPLUTO
Generate files for each boro
	- map only lots
	- pluto only
	- map pluto
Edit xml metadata file and apply xml to each file and convert to pdf
